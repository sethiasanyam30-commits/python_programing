    "Python is a high-level interpreted and object-oriented programming language with dynamic typing and binding For these two reasons it is especially useful for quick application development including scripting to coordinate various software components python offers powerful libraries and simple syntax which is easy to understand and learn Python programmers choose to focus on clarity because it helps to ensure code quality and because they know they will not be working on their code for long the language also facilitates module and package support which helps in structuring code Python incorporates a standard library with a freely distributable interpreter in source code form as well as in binary form for several popular operating systems The software can be freely used without incurring any costs."
